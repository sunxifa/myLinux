A nested loop means loop within loop. You can break out of a certain number of levels in a nested loop by adding break n statement. n is the number of levels of nesting. For example, following code will break out the second done statement: 
 ...
   for i in something
   do
      while true
      do
         cmd1
         cmd2
         [ condition ] && break 2
      done
   done
   ....
   ..
