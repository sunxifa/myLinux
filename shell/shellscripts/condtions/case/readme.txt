1、The case statement allows you to easily check pattern (conditions) and then process a command-line if that condition evaluates to true. 
2、In other words the $variable-name is compared against the patterns until a match is found. 
3、 *) acts as default and it is executed if no match is found. 
4、The pattern can include wildcards. 
5、 You must include ;; at the end of each commandN. The shell executes all the statements up to the two semicolons that are next to each other. 
6、The esac is always required to indicate end of case statement.
