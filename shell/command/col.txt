NAME
     col - filter reverse line feeds from input

SYNOPSIS
     col [-bfpx] [-l num]

DESCRIPTION
     Col filters out reverse (and half reverse) line feeds so the output is in
     the correct order with only forward and half forward line feeds, and
     replaces white-space characters with tabs where possible.	This can be
     useful in processing the output of nroff(1) and tbl(1).

     Col reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -b	    Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last character
	    written to each column position.

     -f	    Forward half line feeds are permitted (‘‘fine’’ mode).  Normally
	    characters printed on a half line boundary are printed on the fol-
	    lowing line.

     -p	    Force unknown control sequences to be passed through unchanged.
	    Normally, col will filter out any control sequences from the input
	    other than those recognized and interpreted by itself, which are
	    listed below.

     -x	    Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.

     -lnum  Buffer at least num lines in memory.  By default, 128 lines are
	    buffered.

     The control sequences for carriage motion that col understands and their
     decimal values are listed in the following table:

     ESC-7	      reverse line feed (escape then 7)
     ESC-8	      half reverse line feed (escape then 8)
     ESC-9	      half forward line feed (escape then 9)
     backspace	      moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column
     carriage return  (13)
     newline	      forward line feed (10); also does carriage return
     shift in	      shift to normal character set (15)
     shift out	      shift to alternate character set (14)
     space	      moves forward one column (32)
     tab	      moves forward to next tab stop (9)
     vertical tab     reverse line feed (11)

     All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are discarded.

     Col keeps track of the character set as characters are read and makes
     sure the character set is correct when they are output.

     If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line, col will dis-
     play a warning message.

[root@www ~]# col [-xb]
选项与参数：
-x  ：将 tab 键转换成对等的空格键
-b  ：过滤掉所有的控制字符，包括RLF（Reverse Line Feed）和HRF（Halt RLF）

范例一：利用 cat -A 显示出所有特殊按键，最后以 col 将 [tab] 转成空白
[root@www ~]# cat -A /etc/man.config  <==此时会看到很多 ^I 的符号，那就是 tab
[root@www ~]# cat /etc/man.config | col -x | cat -A | more
# 嘿嘿！如此一来， [tab] 按键会被取代成为空格键，输出就美观多了！

范例二：将 col 的 man page 转存成为 /root/col.man 的纯文本档
[root@www ~]# man col > /root/col.man
[root@www ~]# vi /root/col.man
